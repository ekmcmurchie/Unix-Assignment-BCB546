## Elizabeth McMurchie UNIX Assignment

### The following descriptions were given by the instructors for the files provided to assist in completing the assignment:

* `UNIX_Assignment.md` and `UNIX_Assignment.pdf`: Instructions for the assignment
* `UNIX_Assignment_Template.md` and `UNIX_Assignment_Template.pdf`: An example of what your Markdown file should look like when you submit your assignment, including some Markdown syntax that should be helpful for you. The pdf shows how this file is rendered using a tool such as "MacDown"
* The two files `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` and `snp_positions.txt` are data files you will be reformatting for the assignment
* The `transpose.awk` script will be needed to transpose the data (see instructions in `UNIX_Assignment.md`)

### I have added the following files to this directory:

* `UNIX_Assignment_MCMurchie.md`: This is my markdown file containing my answers for the assignment.

### I have also added the following directories, which contain my intermediate and final files:

* `intermediate_files`: This directory contains my intermediate files, including a copy of the `transpose.awk` script. 
* `final_files`: This directory contains my final, processed files. The subdirectory `final_maize` contains my final maize files and the subdirectory `final_teosinte` contains my final teosinte files.

Please see the README in each directory for a list of files within them.
