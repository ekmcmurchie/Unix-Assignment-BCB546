# Elizabeth McMurchie Unix Assignment
This directory contains the given files and all my work for the BCB 546 Unix assignment within the "Unix_Assignment" directory.

Given files and my final markdown file are within the main directory. Intermediate files are in the `intermediate_files` directory and final files to the `final_files` directory, which contains two subdirectories: `final_maize` for maize files and `final_teosinte` for teosinte files. See README in the Unix Assignment directory and each other directory (intermediate and final files as well as the final files subdirectories) for a list of these files.
